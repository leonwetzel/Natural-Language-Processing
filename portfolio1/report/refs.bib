	abstract="This chapter presents the Lassy Small and Lassy Large treebanks, as well as related tools and applications. Lassy Small is a corpus of written Dutch texts (1,000,000 words) which has been syntactically annotated with manual verification and correction. Lassy Large is a much larger corpus (over 500,000,000 words) which has been syntactically annotated fully automatically. In addition, various browse and search tools for syntactically annotated corpora have been developed and made available. Their potential for applications in corpus linguistics and information extraction has been illustrated and evaluated in a series of case studies.",
